Amazon INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE 
Over the past few weeks, my inbox has been flooded with messages asking about my Amazon interview experience — and I couldn’t be more grateful for the support and curiosity.
Now that I’ve officially joined Amazon (it’s been 2 weeks!), I thought this would be the right time to share my full interview journey — not as an announcement, but as a small way to give back to this amazing tech community that helped me prepare.
Amazon Interview Process Overview:
✅ 𝗢𝗡𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘 𝗔𝗦𝗦𝗘𝗦𝗦𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧 :
Two DSA-based coding questions to clear the first hurdle and work style assessment.

🎯 Preparation Resources:

System Design basics
GeeksforGeeks + YouTube (for behavioral prep & clarity)
For the behavioural questions I followed the STAR pattern and created a set of my own stories that matches according to the amazon leadership principles and owned my each and every story.
Before every interview, I reminded myself of one simple truth: the result isn't in my hands — but the effort, preparation, and attitude I bring absolutely are.
My only goal was to give my best and come out of the experience as a better version of myself — either one step closer to my career move, or one step wiser with new learnings and insights.
If this post helps even one person feel more confident or hopeful in their own journey, it will mean a lot to me
